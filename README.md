HI all 

This is a part of our AI&DS course work .

It is about a horse race game. Here we can add max of 5 horse deatails(image , age , name etc) foreach groups (A,B,C,D). so totally 20 horses.

While adding you can use update function to update the deatils , delete function for deleting the deatails , view fuction for viewing the horse deatils in acending order and save for saveing the dealis in 5 diffrent text files.

    totel horse test file is for storing the  whole horse deatils .
    Group A  test file is for storing Group A deatils .
    Group B  test file is for storing Group B deatils .
    Group C  test file is for storing Group C deatils .
    Group D  test file is for storing Group D deatils
    
After saving the deatils  here we can use start functin to start the game .

the game load using the text file we saved earlier and put that into each group arrays.

Then from each group one horse will be automaticaly selected randomly.

After that randomly a number will assign to the horse dealis as horse run time .

Using shorting algorithum the (run time) the winner horse will select.

later the winner horse will display in bar chart .
